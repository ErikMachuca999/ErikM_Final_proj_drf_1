# Python Fundamentals Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals Tutorial.  Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [“Fax about Stax”- The rundown about Stacks](1-stack_rundown.md)
- [Topic 2](2-topic2.md)
- [Topic 3](3-topic3md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
